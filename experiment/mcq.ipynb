Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network by that node. The “deep” in deep learning is just referring to the number of layers in a neural network. A neural network that consists of more than three layers—which would be inclusive of the input and the output—can be considered a deep learning algorithm or a deep neural network. A neural network that only has three layers is just a basic neural network.\\n\\nDeep learning and neural networks are credited with accelerating progress in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.',\n",
